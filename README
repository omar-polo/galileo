Galileo is a Gemini proxy for the World Wide Web (www.)  It speaks
FastCGI and is intended to be run behind httpd(8).

Galileo doesn't serve static files, it connects to an upstream Gemini
servers and translate the HTTP requests into Gemini requests.  It
serves the content as-is, with the only exception of translating
text/gemini into HTML.

To compile Galileo on OpenBSD run:

	$ make obj
	$ make
	$ doas make install
